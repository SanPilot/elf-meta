To-do list for features for Elf.

*by Hussain Khalil*

## Description
This file contains a list of features to be added to Elf.

To add an item, add a new line under the last line in the "The List" section and add the item, prepending it with a "\*" character to make it a bullet. Then update the date at the very bottom of the document with the current date.

Instead of removing items from this list, use tildes to strikethrough completed items like ~~this~~.

## The List
* HTTPS configurations for elf-frontend Apache server
* HTTPS server configuration for elf-backend proxy
* An option in elf-frontend to pin important items to top
* A daemon module for special configuration for API routes such as specified hostnames and subdirectories
